#Program4
This program reads Employee object data from an csv file, determines the subclass of
each object based on parameter size (Faculty or Student Employee), places each Employee
object into a sorted arraylist of its respective category, calculates total pay for
student employees, and prints the formatted results to a seperate csv file.
